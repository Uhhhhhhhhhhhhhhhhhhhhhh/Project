LionPlanner History:
LionPlanner was developed for the purpose of abolishing the previous analog method of scheduling used by the Resistrar at Penn State University: Berks Campus. The previous analog method involved the use of a whiteboard and constant human communication to determine the possible schedule, which lead to issues with efficiency and human communication error. LionPlanner streamlines this with a simple to follow GUI which allows better organization of data and efficiency for the registrar when scheduling. For other users such as the Professors, a calendar view is available to make visualizing course and make changes based off preferences easy.
